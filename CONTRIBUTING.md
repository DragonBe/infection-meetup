# How to contribute

I love writing code and encourage others to do so as well. I also understand that if you're new to programming, getting started can be a bit of a challenge. Where do I start? What should I build? What is expected of me? These are typical questions newcomers to the world of development ask themselves.

I would like to make it easier for everyone to enjoy the freedom and liberty of enjoying the craft of building something with bits and bytes, so therefor I've made this tutorial application where the basic goal is already set up for you to try it out on your own. But there are bugs left to fix and features to be build, so you can start dipping your toes into the facinating world of contribution to open source.

## So what is expected of you?

Well, if you'd like you can have a look at the issues list here on GitHub where you can find several bugs marked as "easy fix". These bugs are intentially put in place for you to solve. There are also some features left open where functionality has to be written in order to complete the feature. These issues are marked as "feature".

To ensure you can work in your own time at your own pace, the best practice is to "fork" this project into your own GitHub account. Please read GitHub's excellent documentation on [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). This allows you to do all the things in your own account until you're satisfied with the result.

If you want to develop with the source code, you need to clone your personal fork onto your local development machine. Again GitHub has a perfect guide to help you with that: see step 2 in [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork).

Once you have completed your task, you push your code from your local development machine onto your personal GitHub account. From there you can send me a "pull request" or PR. This means that I get a notification that you have a fix for the code base. I review it, provide feedback that you need to follow up on and once we come to an agreement, your "pull request" is accepted and merged into the main source code. All that's left for you is to sync your fork and local machine to stay current.

## Do I need to sign up before I fork or send a pull request?

Not with this source code repository, but you must have a GitHub account in order to participate. There are ways to go beyond GitHub, but that's not really the goal here. Let's keep things simple and easy to start with before we drop ourselves over the vulcanic ledge into the deep fires of the Dragon's Lair.

## How do I contact you with questions?

You can always email me, my e-mail address is added to my account so it's easy to spot. If you would like to send me a secured message, my PGP fingerprint is `5732 D8FE EDE8 D59F E59F 1597 70DF 8F88 2024 203C` and you can [download my public key](https://www.in2it.be/2024203C.txt). If all else fails, reach out to me on at [@DragonBe](https://twitter.com/DragonBe) on Twitter.
